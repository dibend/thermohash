## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### API Data Sources

1. **Bitcoin Price**: CoinGecko API (Free tier)
   - Endpoint: `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price`
   - Rate limiting: 5-minute cache
   - Data: Price, 24h change, market cap

2. **Network Data**: Blockchain.info API
   - Endpoint: `https://api.blockchain.info/stats`
   - Fallback: Estimated network parameters
   - Data: Hashrate, difficulty, network stats

### Calculation Formulas

**Hashprice Calculation:**
```
Daily Hashprice (USD/TH) = (3.125 BTC Ã— 144 blocks/day Ã— BTC Price) / Network Hashrate (TH)
```

**Mining Profitability:**
```
Hashrate (TH/s) = Power (W) / Efficiency (J/TH)
Daily Revenue = Hashrate Ã— Hashprice
Daily Cost = (Power Ã— 24h / 1000) Ã— Electricity Rate
Daily Profit = Revenue - Cost
Profit Margin = (Profit / Revenue) Ã— 100%
```

### Enhanced ML Features

**Input Vector (9 features):**
1. Temperature (Â°C)
2. Humidity (%)
3. Wind Speed (km/h)
4. Wind Direction (degrees)
5. Weather Code
6. Hour of Day (0-23)
7. Bitcoin Price (USD)
8. Hashprice (USD/TH/day)
9. Network Hashrate (EH/s)
