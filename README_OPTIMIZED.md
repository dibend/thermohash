## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The system uses an enhanced `config.json` file with additional optimization parameters:

```json
{
    "latitude": 40.6982,
    "longitude": -74.4014,
    "miner_address": "192.168.1.100",
    "username": "root",
    "password": "your_password",
    "temp_thresholds": {
        "10.0": 1000,
        "15.0": 900,
        "20.0": 800,
        "25.0": 700,
        "30.0": 600,
        "35.0": 500,
        "40.0": 400
    },
    "prediction_settings": {
        "forecast_hours": 24,
        "prediction_model_enabled": true,
        "retrain_interval_hours": 168,
        "min_training_samples": 100
    },
    "optimization_settings": {
        "check_interval_minutes": 10,
        "prediction_weight": 0.7,
        "current_weather_weight": 0.3,
        "power_smoothing_factor": 0.8
    },
    "logging": {
        "level": "INFO",
        "file_path": "/var/log/thermohash.log"
    }
}
```

### Configuration Parameters

#### Basic Settings
- `latitude/longitude`: Your location for weather data
- `miner_address`: IP or hostname of your Braiins OS miner
- `username/password`: Miner authentication credentials
- `temp_thresholds`: Temperature to power mapping (¬∞C: watts)

#### Prediction Settings
- `forecast_hours`: Hours of weather forecast to fetch (1-72)
- `prediction_model_enabled`: Enable/disable ML optimization
- `retrain_interval_hours`: How often to retrain the model (default: 168 = 1 week)
- `min_training_samples`: Minimum data points needed for training

#### Optimization Settings
- `check_interval_minutes`: How often to check and adjust power
- `prediction_weight`: Weight given to ML predictions (0.0-1.0)
- `current_weather_weight`: Weight given to current weather (0.0-1.0)
- `power_smoothing_factor`: Smoothing applied to power changes (0.0-1.0)

## üéØ How It Works

### Traditional Mode (Fallback)
1. Fetches current temperature from OpenMeteo API
2. Maps temperature to power target using configured thresholds
3. Sets miner power target via gRPC

### Optimized Mode (With ML)
1. Fetches current weather and 24-hour forecast
2. Uses neural network to predict optimal power based on:
   - Temperature
   - Humidity  
   - Wind speed and direction
   - Weather conditions
   - Time of day
3. Combines ML prediction with traditional temperature mapping
4. Applies power smoothing to prevent rapid changes
5. Continuously learns from decisions to improve predictions

### Machine Learning Model
- **Input features**: 6 weather/time parameters
- **Architecture**: 32‚Üí16‚Üí8‚Üí1 dense layers with dropout
- **Training**: Automatic retraining on historical data
- **Persistence**: Models saved to disk for continuity

## üîÑ Usage

### Running the Application
```bash
# Using virtual environment (recommended)
./thermohash_env/bin/python thermohash_optimized.py

# Or directly (if dependencies installed globally)
python thermohash_optimized.py
```

### As a Service (Linux)
```bash
# Enable automatic startup
sudo systemctl enable thermohash

# Start the service
sudo systemctl start thermohash

# Check status
sudo systemctl status thermohash

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u thermohash -f
```

### Monitoring
```bash
# View real-time logs
tail -f /var/log/thermohash.log

# Or on Windows
type thermohash.log
```

## üìä Performance & Benefits

### Resource Usage
- **CPU**: Minimal impact (~1-2% during adjustments)
- **Memory**: ~100MB base + ~200MB with ML features
- **Network**: <1KB per weather check (every 10 minutes)
- **Disk**: ~50MB for TensorFlow CPU, models <10MB

### Optimization Benefits
- **Improved efficiency**: ML learns optimal settings over time
- **Smoother operation**: Reduced power fluctuations
- **Predictive adjustments**: Anticipates weather changes
- **Self-improving**: Performance improves with more data

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**TensorFlow/ML features not working:**
```bash
# Install with ML support
pip install tensorflow-cpu scikit-learn

# Or disable ML in config
"prediction_model_enabled": false
```

**grpcurl not found (Windows):**
- Download from [grpcurl releases](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/releases)
- Extract `grpcurl.exe` to your PATH or script directory

**Connection refused to miner:**
- Ensure port 50051 is open on your miner
- Check miner IP address in config
- Verify Braiins OS is running

**Permission denied on log file (Linux):**
```bash
sudo chmod 666 /var/log/thermohash.log
# Or change log path in config to writable location
```

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting log level to "DEBUG" in config:
```json
"logging": {
    "level": "DEBUG",
    "file_path": "/var/log/thermohash.log"
}
```

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Credentials**: Use environment variables for sensitive data:
  ```bash
  export MINER_USERNAME="your_username"
  export MINER_PASSWORD="your_password"
  ```
- **Network**: Ensure miner is on a secure network
- **Firewall**: Restrict access to port 50051 on your miner
